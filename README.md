# DSI DataBase Fan

This project was created for the mexican company Software DSI.

The aim is to controll the fans that cool the database room with a microcontroller.

This projects consists of two parts:

1.- C code for the microcontroller.
This is the code that tells the microcontroller what to do. It needs to be compiled with a program that can produce the files that we actually upload to the microcontroller.

2.- Proteus simulation.
To probe that the program as well as the electronic schematics is ok, a proteus simulation was created. An image of the running simulation is showed below.
